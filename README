What
====

This is a small Bash script to assemble, link, and run 16-bit x86 `.asm` programs using TASM inside DOSBox.

How
===

Put your `.asm` file in this directory, then run:

```
./run_asm.sh file.asm
```

Add `-d` for debug file.
Add `-nc` to skip cleanup.

Where
====

- Uses `./TASM` as the DOSBox C: drive.

Why
===
Because manually typing `mount c: ~/TASM` every time got annoying

Requirements
============

- `dosbox-staging`

Note
====

This project does not include TASM.EXE, TLINK.EXE or TD.EXE due to licensing restrictions.
You can find them on the internet.
